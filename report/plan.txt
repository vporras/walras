  introduction
    brief motivation
    summarize results 


  background & related work
    what is walrasian equilibrium?
    divisible vs indivisible goods
    centralized vs decentralized
      information we have access to
    what are the centralized solutions?
      tatonnement
      simplex cutting


  model
    2 goods
    utility function
      Cobb-Douglass
      gradients
    bilateral trade over a day
      MRS
      plus-utility trades only
      FIGURE: closeup of buy/sell gradients at allocation, with potential trades
    wealth loss & constraints
      FIGURE: price/volume for 1 trader over a couple days
        area over curve is wealth lost
        show constraints


  implementation
    single day
      FIGURE: small number of traders on one day
      picking price
      stopping conditions

    multiple day
      useful statistics
        wealth transfer
        average utility gain
        mrs closeness
        constrainedness
      FIGURE: convergence with simple model

    trade sizing
      FIGURE: static and dynamic on one day
      EXP: static
      EXP: dyanmic
        
    number of traders?
      FIGURE: comparison with different numbers of traders
      EXP: simple model over various numbers

    convergence
      significance
      conditions
      speed & quality

    divergence - death spirals
      FIGURE: convergence then death spiral
      conditions
      cause
      prevention

    time & complexity
      clock
      calls to oracle

    testing
      choosing number of rounds
      random allocations, but same seed for each model
      summary statistics
        % convergence
        % divergence
        convergence and final stats


  experimentation
    constraint type
      EXP: fixed
      EXP: last price
      EXP: mean (of cur constraint & last price)
      EXP: VWAP
    reversion method
      EXP: mean
      EXP: total
      EXP: random?
    FIGURE: bar charts comparing methods

    backtracking
      justification
        longer term relationships
        many variables being optimized at once
          could lose utility due to
            randomness
            my actions
            others' actions
      EXP: single backtrack
      EXP: multiple backtrack
      EXP: diff backtrack probabilities
      EXP: diff backtrack thresholds

    stability across seeds
      EXP: same allocations, different seeds

    relaxing the differentiablity assumption
      same utility function
        EXP: normal vs random mrs

      different utility function
        EXP: leontief? 
        EXP: randomised utility function?


  conclusion
    comparing this model to centralized
      advantages and disadvantages
    how could this be useful?
