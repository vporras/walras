  In general, we like to see reasoning behind th design choices you have made. This shows you are being thoughtful and deliberate, and provides insight into the techniques.

questions
=========
  should constrainedness be flipped?
  the word "model"
    -- what do I call a set of parameters? experimental setup?
  are the table column names clear enough?
  can I say backtracking is novel?
  he/her/they for traders



time metrics
============
  wall clock for comparison with 
    not system independent
  pairs (all trades)
    seem more natural to Paul
  non-zero trades
  calls to oracles (sensitive to dynamic sizing)
     maybe use later

motivation
==========
  tatonnement is like centrally planned economy
  restrictions on pricing or utility functions


information we have access to
=============================
  whether traders will accept a trade or not
  their MRS at a given point
    is this realistic?
    needs differentiability
  without differentiability
    can used stochastic utility functions


figures
=======
  price/volume for 1 trader over a couple days
    area over curve is wealth lost
    show constraint
  1 day among 2, 3, 4 traders
  across time for 100 traders
  bar charts comparing experiments
