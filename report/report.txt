Model
    This project focuses on simulating a world with two divisible goods that can be exchanged between a number of traders.

    The _marginal rate of substitution_ between our two goods will be used throughout to represent price.
    It applies to both actual and potential trades.
    We always express the MRS and gradient (defined below) as units of good 2 per unit good 1.
    For instance, a trade of 4 units of good 1 for 1 unit of good 2 has an MRS of 0.25.

    The _direction_ of a trade is either "Buy" or "Sell", from the perspective of a given trader.
    Direction is also expressed in terms of good 1, so a "Buy" means the trader is gaining good 1 by giving up good 2.

    Utility functions capture the preferences of the actors in an economic model.
    Utility is often identified with the pleasure or satisfaction that an actor gets from a situation.
    The utility is defined such that people always prefer an outcome with higher utility to one with lower 
    In general, a utility function is a function from states of the world to utilities.
    In our case, it will be a function from allocations of our two goods to utilities.

    We will often refer to the gradient of the utility function at a certain allocation.
    This gradient bounds the MRS of an infinitesimally small trade at that point.
    A trader will not buy Good1 in a trade with an MRS that is higher than their gradient, because they would lose utility.  

    For the first part of the project, we use a special kind of utility function called Cobb-Douglass.
    


Implementation

  Single Day

    Each day of the simulation begins by giving each trader their initial endowment.
    Then, pairs of traders are randomly selected to attempt a trade.
    Each trader has access to their utility functions and the gradients of those functions for any allocation.
    From the gradient and any constraints, we calculate two MRSs for each trader, one for each direction.
    The direction of the potential trade (Trader1 buying from T2 or vice versa) is chosen based on the differences between their MRSs.
    The trader with the higher MRS is the one who buys Good 1.

    Then, we calculate the size of the biggest possible trade that can occur at that price.
    A trade can occur if, after reallocation, both traders would have higher utilities.
    We test progressively larger sizes, doubling each time.
    Because the gradient only applies to infinitesimally small sizes, when the MRSs are very similar, the minimum size might not be possible.
